## About me

I'm a freshman in BSUIR on faculty of Computer-Aided Design. In the 8-th form of my school I started to participate in competitive programming olympiads. Have some experience in frameworks such as **JSP** and **Django**.

Because of my good learning ability and positivity, I can fit into any team. I will not be bored :)

So I'm currently taking courses in Front-end development, wanting to try something new for myself.
